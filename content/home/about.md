# Biography

I am a senior researcher in the team *Digital Society Observatory* at [*GESIS - Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences*](https://www.gesis.org/en/home) ([Department *Computational Social Science*](https://www.gesis.org/en/institute/departments/computational-social-science)) in Cologne, Germany, and lead the team *Research Data & Methods* at the [*Center for Advanced Internet Studies* (CAIS)](https://www.cais-research.de/en/team/johannes-breuer/) in Bochum, Germany. 

My research focuses on the uses and effects of digital media, data linking (esp. linking surveys with digital trace data), data management, and open science. I frequently give workshops on topics related to quantitative and computational research methods and the statistical programming language `R`, and have also taught classes in psychology and communication at both the graduate and undergraduate level. 

You can also find me on Mastodon (<a rel="me" href="https://fediscience.org/@JohannesBreuer" cfmodified="modified">@JohannesBreuer@fediscience.org</a>) and [BlueSky](https://bsky.app/profile/jobreu.bsky.social).
