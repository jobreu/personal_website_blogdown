# Biography

I am a senior researcher and team leader at [*GESIS - Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences*](https://www.gesis.org/en/home), [Department *Computational Social Science*](https://www.gesis.org/en/institute/departments/computational-social-science) in Cologne, Germany.

My research focuses on the uses and effects of digital media, digital trace data, computational methods, data management, open science, and meta-science. I frequently give workshops on topics related to quantitative and computational research methods and the statistical programming language `R`, and have also taught classes in psychology and communication at both the graduate and undergraduate level. 

You can also find me on Mastodon (<a rel="me" href="https://fediscience.org/@JohannesBreuer" cfmodified="modified">@JohannesBreuer@fediscience.org</a>) and [BlueSky](https://bsky.app/profile/johannesbreuer.com).
