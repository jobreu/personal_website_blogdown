# Biography

I am a senior researcher in the team *Survey Data Augmentation* at [*GESIS - Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences*](https://www.gesis.org/en/home) ([Department *Survey Data Curation*](https://www.gesis.org/en/institute/departments/survey-data-curation)) in Cologne, Germany, and (co-)lead the team *Research Data & Methods* at the [*Center for Advanced Internet Studies* (CAIS)](https://www.cais-research.de/) in Bochum, Germany. 

My research focuses on the uses and effects of digital media, data linking (esp. linking surveys with digital trace data), data management, and open science. I frequently give workshops on topics related to quantitative and computational research methods and the statistical programming language `R`, and have also taught classes in psychology and communication at both the graduate and undergraduate level.
