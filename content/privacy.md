**Disclaimer**: All the following information should be read as “to the best of my knowledge”. I am not a website expert. I can only tell you about my intentions and the measures I took to protect the privacy of visitors to my website.

## Collection of your personal information

Nothing on this website requires you to identify yourself.

The website does not use [cookies](https://www.cookiesandyou.com/). *Note*: Most web browsers allow you to [control the handling of cookies](https://cookies.insites.com/disable-cookies/).

I have set the [Hugo Privacy options](https://gohugo.io/about/hugo-and-gdpr/#all-privacy-settings) so that all third-party services, including Google Analytics, should be disabled on this website.

## Sharing of your personal information

As I do not collect your personal information there is nothing I can share.

*Acknowledgment*: To optimize the privacy settings on my website and for the wording of this privacy notice I have followed the solutions proposed in a [blog post by Ross Gayler](https://www.rossgayler.com/post/2018/07/07/updating-my-website-for-gdpr/).
